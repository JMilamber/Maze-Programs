# Maze-Programs
A repository of programs that create mazes, with a central program from which you can run all the mazes from. 


- ## Running The Program
   **!!! This Progam uses Python and cannot run if python is not Installed !!!**
  
   Navigate to this repository in your terminal window and run the program using either:
   
   `python MazeMainProgram.py` or `MazeMainProgram.py`
  
- ## GUI
    Maze-Programs uses [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for its GUI Interface. 
   
   
- ## MazeMainProgram.py 
    This program is the core of this the Maze-Programs Repository, as it allows you to run all of the sub-programs without 
    entering any sub folders. 
  
   
- ## Randomized Recursive Backtracker
    
    ### Algorithm:
    
    Uses a randomized version of the Recursive Backtracker algorithm, which can be seen on Jamis Buck's Website: [JamisBuck.org](https://www.jamisbuck.org/mazes/) 
    and is described in: [Think Labyrinth Describes the Classification of Mazes](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm) under 
    "Perfect Maze Creation Algorithms".
    
      
    
- ## Recursive Division 

    ### Algorithm:
    
    Uses the Recursive division algorithm which can be seen on Jamis Buck's Website: [JamisBuck.org](https://www.jamisbuck.org/mazes/) 
    and is described in: [Think Labyrinth Describes the Classification of Mazes](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm) under 
    "Perfect Maze Creation Algorithms".
    
- ## Self Created Modules

    ### StringToNumber: 
     
    stringToNumber contains a single method called strToInt.
    That method takes a single parameter, a string that consists 
    of any combination of numbers and characters.
